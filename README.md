# Natural-Language-Processing
Welcome to my NLP course projects completed during my time at the University of Bucharest. These assignments highlight fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Starting with web scraping from IMDB using tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, I learned to collect data for analysis. The journey continued with text cleanup techniques, making the text consistent and manageable. I then explored how to break down text into meaningful parts, laying the foundation for analysis. Techniques like simplifying words for better understanding were also part of my learning. Lastly, I delved into the world of text data exploration, learning to draw insights that guide informed decisions. Whether you're a fellow student or someone interested in grasping NLP basics, these beginner-friendly projects provide a practical learning experience.
